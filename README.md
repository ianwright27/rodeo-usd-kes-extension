## 🧠 How It Works

* The extension injects a small script that finds your Rodeo Wallet balance in USD.
* It fetches the latest USD-to-local-currency exchange rate from a free currency API.
* It calculates and displays the converted value (e.g. `KES 469.96`) right beside your wallet amount.

## 📡 API

By default, it uses [**ExchangeRate-API**](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) for real-time conversion.
You can switch to any open currency API by updating the `fetch` URL inside `content.js`.

## 🖼 Icon

The extension icon (`icon128.png`) represents a minimal currency theme — you can replace it with your own 128×128 design.
